P4Q1: In the Northwind database, what is the type of relationship between the
  `Employee` and `Territory` tables?

- The 'Employee' and 'Territory' tables have a many-to-many relationship.
  A many-to-many relationship occurs when multiple records in a table are
  associated with multiple records in another table. 
  A single employee can have multiple territories just as one territory can belong
  to many employees. The joining table EmployeeTerriroty is used as a result of this.


P4Q2: What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and
  what is a situation where it is not appropriate?

- The motivation of the MongoDB language is to implement a data store that provides high 
  performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. Although, the tradeoff is scale for
  readability. With MongoDB it's harder to manage and query the data. For example a bank would
  not be a great choice for document stores such as MongoDB because of its lack of ACIC compliance
  and the neccessity of the transactions to be correct.


P4Q3: What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?

- NewSQL is a type of database language that incorporates and builds on the concepts and
  principles of Structured Query Language (SQL) and NoSQL languages. By combining the
  reliability of SQL with the speed and performance of NoSQL, NewSQL provides improved 
  functionality and services. It can be looked at as a mixture of document stores and
  relational databases in order to achieve more speed and ACID compliance.
